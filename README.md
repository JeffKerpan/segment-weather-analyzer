#Strava Segment Weather Analysis
##Purpose
The purpose of this web app is to analyze segment efforts on Strava and determine if wind was a considerable factor in the performance.

##Features
* Easy to use interface
* Appealing design
* Quick operation

##How Does it Work?
This web application makes use of the `Strava API Version 3`, and `Forecast API Version 2`. With the use of `JQuery AJAX requests`, the table is populated. Due to limitations in the Strava API Version 3, each user has to enter their authentication ID to view their performance on segments that they participated in. Apart from fetching information, most of the operations were done using vectors, trigonometry, and some longitude/latitude knowledge! The front-end of the website was made possible through the use of `Materialize CSS`.
